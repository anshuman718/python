a = 45

b = 5 

print(a+b*6)

print ("History of england")



t = 55

r = 56
# we have given the values of the variables t and r to python.
print(t+r>444)

print(t*r>444)

#Here we have told python to first print the sum of a b and c then print the text given in the string and then an example of  boolean operator 
# , we have asked whether the sum of t and r is greater than 444 or not. The  output is false and vice versa.
